Objects: 1, 2

Morphisms: 

1 -> 1: id1
2 -> 2: id2
1 -> 2: f
2 -> 1: (empty set)

Composition:
  id1 . id1 = id1
  id2 . id2 = id2
  f . id1 = f
  id2 . f = f

Right unit: f . id1 = f
Left unit: id2 . f = f

Associativity: as we only compose with identity, the associativity is trivial,

   id2 . f . id1 (the only 3 morphisms) = (id2 . f) . id1 = id2 . (f . id1) = f

\section{Is it an isomorphism?}

Yes. Since g . f :: c -> c and f . g :: d -> d both must be valid morphisms
in the category, and the only morphisms c -> c and d -> d are the identities,
then g . f = id_c and f . g = id_d, q.e.d.
