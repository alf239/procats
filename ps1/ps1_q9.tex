\section{ Defining a toy category in Haskell. }

Since we only have two oblects and three arrows, we can simply encode those as ADTs. 
To encode objects, we need to choose between a standard \mintinline{haskell}{Either () ()} and a custom data type;
the latter seems to be more readable:

\inputminted[firstline=28,
             lastline=56,
             fontsize=\footnotesize, tabsize=4]{haskell}{ps1.hs}

It is easy to see that the code closely follows the answer to question 2.
